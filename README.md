It is common practice to have a Loan IQ landing page. This is a Node.JS version in progress.

Loan IQ servers (& Clients) contain an apps folder.
Example apps are an API test client.
This app sits within the server apps folder and exposes details of the environment.
Examples are branch , environment , build version.

Benefit is the server environments remain secure while users can see the details and up status.

TODO : expose the tomcat service server logs (JR/api) for reading in a browser.
